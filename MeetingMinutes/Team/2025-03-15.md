## Topics Discussed

Deadlines, what needs to happen for a successful iteration. 

## Things Clarified

Map feature is absolute top priority, testing coverage close second. Client must have a hands-on with the app during the client meeting. Firebase modularity completed. Map must be implemented by Sunday or Monday to leave room for bug fixing before Iteration day.

## Tasks Distributed

Angeles and Devlin will work on map feature. Ethan and Shaun will bring testing coverage up to 70% minimum. William will work on documentation updates and presentation, while helping where needed with the former tasks.
