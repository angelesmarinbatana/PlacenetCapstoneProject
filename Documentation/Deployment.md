## Deploying

Deployment is handled by Firebase, which you must be invited to in order to manage relevant backend operations.

Should you run into issues related to Firebase, you can troubleshoot errors by temporarily changing the database or storage rules in the Firebase panel, or by creating your own firebase project and connecting the project to it.
