## One Paragraph per team memeber 
1. Angeles:
   - It was a cool expereince being able to oberserve the capstone projects of other people and get to share your own. It was cool to have other people teach you about their area of study and then be able to teach them something they didn't know about as well. Overall it was a really good expereince.
